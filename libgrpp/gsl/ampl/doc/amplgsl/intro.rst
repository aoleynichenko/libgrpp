Introduction
============

The GNU Scientific Library (GSL) is a collection of routines for numerical
computing. The routines have been written from scratch in C, and present
a modern Applications Programming Interface (API) for C programmers,
allowing wrappers to be written for very high level languages. The source
code is distributed under the GNU General Public License.

The AMPLGSL library provides AMPL
`bindings <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_binding>`_ for the
GNU Scientific Library and is distributed under the same license.
